## What this is

Walk through any big financial firm and you'll see specialists who don't cross-read. The patent lawyer reads USPTO filings. The insurance actuary reads NAIC reserves. The CMBS servicer reads Trepp. None reads the others. So the facts are public, the cross-silo *implication* is private, and only the price shows it. The price is often wrong.

HUNTER is a Python program that reads across all of them at once. It pulls dated facts from 18 silos (patents, SEC filings, NAIC reserves, OSHA actions, CMBS delinquency, Federal Register rules, commodity inventories, analyst targets, academic preprints, pharma approvals, distressed credit, healthcare REITs, energy infrastructure, specialty real estate, government contracts, earnings transcripts, job listings, app rankings), breaks each fact into entities / implications / methodology fields / named causal arrows, looks for pairs that together imply something neither implies alone, runs each pair through a four-round kill gauntlet designed to destroy it, and posts survivors to a public prediction board with an asset, a direction, and a resolution date.

It is also the measurement platform for a pre-registered 12-week empirical study of *compositional alpha*, cross-silo information asymmetries no single specialist captures, running out-of-sample from June 1 through August 31, 2026.

## Status

**Early research.** The pipeline is built and runs. The corpus is frozen. The prediction board is live and empty on purpose: it fills from June 1 as summer hypotheses clear the upgraded three-tier pipeline (Opus 4.7 for the critical reasoning, Sonnet 4.5 for extraction, Haiku 4.5 for ingestion). Zero predictions have resolved as of launch. First resolutions hit the ledger mid-July. The 12-week summer study is the first real out-of-sample run.

Some patterns showed up in the pre-freeze corpus. A sharp asymmetry between mechanism-focused and audience-focused kill success. A hub-and-spoke shape in the methodology graph around ARGUS Enterprise DCF cap-rate assumptions. A bimodal distribution of quality scores. A negative correlation between narrative strength and kill survival (r = −0.49). Nine closed Tarjan cycles. None of these are claimed as findings. They are held back as hypotheses the summer will test.

## Provenance

This repository is the public release of a six-month private solo build (November 2025 through April 2026). The git history shows a short commit series because the audit trail was never intended to live in git: it lives in the SHA-256-locked pre-registration manifest (`preregistration.json`, code hash `f39d2f5ff6b3e695`, locked 2026-04-19), the timestamped frozen corpus on Zenodo (DOI pending), and the public, timestamped prediction board. Anyone auditing a claim runs `python run.py preregister check` against the manifest; independent replication runs against the frozen Zenodo corpus and the locked code hash, not against the commit history.

## Corpus reconciliation

Two numbers appear in this repository and they measure different things. **Published corpus: 12,030 facts** (the full ingested set released via Zenodo v1, CC-BY-4.0). **Pre-registration-eligible subset: 3,557 facts** (the subset dated on or before the 2024-12-31 cutoff; facts ingested but dated later are quarantined from the primary test). `preregister.py` hashes the eligible subset's fact IDs and locks the hash in `preregistration.json`. Pre-existing collisions in the database mix pre- and post-cutoff facts and are not used for the primary test; the summer study regenerates collisions from the frozen pre-cutoff subset only. The strata partials currently stored in the manifest (A:5, B:5, C:8, D:25) are provisional counts from pre-regeneration collisions; the locked strata counts will be recomputed on the eligible subset at the start of the summer run.

## A note on the operator

This is built and run by one person: John Malpass, second-year BSc Economics at University College Dublin. That's relevant context for how the work should be read. The repo is public on purpose: priority of discovery is claimed at the moment of posting, and honest public critique is worth more than private reassurance. Prior-art pointers, design criticism, and replication attempts all welcome. Contact below.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Johnmalpass/hunter-research.git
cd hunter-research
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # add your API keys

# dashboard (no API required, reads the frozen corpus)
python run.py dashboard

# one-screen state of the system (no API)
python run.py status

# full pipeline (requires API budget; honours the preregistration freeze)
python run.py live

# verify nothing has drifted against the manifest
python run.py preregister check

Every stage is defined in `prompts.py` (26 LLM prompts, one per step) and routed through `config.py` (18 source types, 153-pair hand-calibrated domain distance matrix, 220 ingest queries). The causal graph, model-field extractions, and adversarial review traces all persist to 43 database tables.

The seven collision strategies run in parallel per anomaly: implication matching, entity matching, keyword matching, model-field matching, causal-graph traversal, embedding similarity, belief-reality contradiction. Matches get blended, evaluated by an LLM, checked against prior publication, and promoted to hypotheses with resolution dates. The kill gauntlet then runs four adversarial rounds (mechanism, fact-check, competitor, barrier) plus a market-check; survivors get scored in a fresh context by an adversarial reviewer against four calibration anchors.

## Pre-registered summer 2026 study

A 12-week out-of-sample study runs June 1 through August 31, 2026 on the frozen corpus. Manifest locked at SHA-256 `f39d2f5ff6b3e695`.

**Primary test.** Median realised alpha over SPY total return, ordered across four strata by how many distinct silos the hypothesis combines: A (1) ≤ B (2) ≤ C (3) ≤ D (≥4), with D − A > 0 at p < 0.05 under a 10,000-resample paired bootstrap. Strata are fixed in `config.py`.

**Secondary tests.**
- **H2.** Detected cycles (reinforcement ≥ 0.5) persist uncorrected in the market for ≥ 14 days in ≥ 2 of the 9 currently detected cycles.
- **H3.** Cross-silo collisions (domain distance ≥ 0.60) score ≥ 10 points higher than within-silo (< 0.30) on average.
- **H4.** Chain-depth-3 hypotheses outperform chain-depth-1 at Cohen's d ≥ 0.3.

**Null baselines (committed in advance).**
- **B1 random-pair.** Facts drawn from distinct source types at random.
- **B2 within-silo.** Same-source-type pairing forced.
- **B3 shuffled-label.** Source-type labels shuffled before pipeline execution.

**Decision rules** (fixed in `preregistration.json`):
- Primary wins: accept the compositional alpha hypothesis; empirical paper ships.
- Primary loses (D ≤ B or monotonicity violated): reject; null-result paper ships.
- No post-hoc corpus additions. No scoring-weight changes. No primary/secondary swap. No retroactive exclusion. All four strata reported regardless of sign.

**Prior contradictory evidence, and why the study still runs.** An earlier retrospective pilot (the "v3 Golden" validation run, `V3_GOLDEN_*` constants in `config.py`) produced Stratum D < Stratum B, directly contradicting H1. That pilot ran with `RETROSPECTIVE_DISABLE_WEB_SEARCH = True`, i.e. the kill phase could not check causal mechanisms against live web evidence, which is the specific channel through which cross-silo advantages are supposed to manifest. The summer 2026 study runs prospectively with web-searched mechanism kills, the regime H1 is actually about. If the summer study also produces D ≤ B or violates monotonicity, the manifest's decision rule kicks in: reject H1, ship the null paper, treat the framework as needing structural revision (not recalibration). See `THEORY_CANON.md` §2 claim C4 for the full epistemic state.

Drift during the study is auto-detected by `python run.py preregister check` and reported in the final paper.

Pre-freeze patterns (the mechanism-vs-audience kill asymmetry, the hub-and-spoke methodology graph around ARGUS Enterprise DCF assumptions, the bimodal diamond-score distribution, the narrative-survival correlation r = −0.49, the nine detected Tarjan cycles) are secondary hypotheses for the summer to test. Not findings.

## What this is not

- Not a fund, not a product, not a pitch. Nothing here solicits capital or clients.
- Not a commentary Substack dressed as code. The code is the primary artifact.
- Not a claim of a specific hit rate, return, or market-size opportunity. The ledger establishes track record, starting June 2026.
