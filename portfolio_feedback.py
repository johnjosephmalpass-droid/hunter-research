"""Portfolio → Scoring feedback loop.

Problem: the scorer and the portfolio are currently disconnected. The
scorer doesn't know that the last 5 CRE-contamination theses all lost
money, so it keeps scoring the 6th similarly high. This module closes
that loop.

Mechanism: every time a position closes, we record the thesis embedding
+ the realised P&L. Every time a new hypothesis is formed, we look up
the most similar recently-closed theses and apply a calibration delta
to the score (penalty for loser-like theses, small boost for winner-like).

This is a simple, interpretable, auditable form of online learning.
No ML model to train. Just cosine similarity against a rolling window
of closed positions.

Bain-defensible framing: this is "regime-aware scoring" — the system
learns which kinds of theses have been rewarded by the market *recently*
and adjusts confidence accordingly. Not a black box.
