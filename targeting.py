CRITICAL CONTEXT, what you must know:
- HUNTER is a solo-operator research instrument
- The hypothesis database has been cleared multiple times during development/debugging; the archived count represents ALL historical output, not just current
- The system went through major evolution: single-domain clustering -> diverse cross-domain output
- Key architectural milestones: search-grounded gate (replaced LLM-judging-LLM), five-element model-vulnerability extraction, disruption-assumption validation, transitive chaining, feedback loop, domain concentration ceiling
- The scoring cap at 45 means any hypothesis where market awareness found the edge was gone gets hard-capped; many 45-score hypotheses had raw scores of 65-81
- Pre-freeze diamond-grade hypotheses exist in the corpus but are held as replication-comparison objects, not validated findings, until the summer study reports

Be SPECIFIC. Reference actual source types by name. Reference actual hypotheses by collision_id. Reference specific kill patterns with examples. Do NOT give generic advice like "increase diversity" — give actionable specifics.""",
